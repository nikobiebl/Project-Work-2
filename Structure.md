## Working Title:
Machine Learning for Email Phishing Detection on a Novel Data Set
## Problem Definition:
Comprehensive email traffic remains by far the biggest security risk in large companies and cyberattacks are becoming increasingly popular as a result. Consequently, many companies are forced to make significant investments in cybersecurity. One effective method of reducing the risk of phishing emails and alleviating the burden on cybersecurity teams is the automated classification of emails using machine learning classifiers.
Since email data from companies usually contains confidential and internal information, this data is not available to the public or the scientific community. Therefore, the number of email datasets from real corporate contexts is significantly low. The few datasets that are available are neither up to date nor of high quality.
In May 2024, a new comprehensive phishing email dataset was published that combines the six most scientifically relevant datasets from this area into one. This has created a new opportunity and demand to test the performance of the most suitable methods for classifying phishing emails and to compare the results with previous studies.
Which machine learning algorithms have the best performance for the automated classification of corporate phishing emails based on the new comprehensive phishing email data set? How do the new results compare to the current state of research?
## Objective:
The primary objective is to identify the best performing algorithms for the automated classification of phishing emails within corporate environments. Additionally, the aim is to validate whether the results from current state of research accurately reflect the performance and effectiveness of these algorithms when applied to the new comprehensive dataset.
## Research Methodology:
A mixed-methods approach was chosen to answer the research question and achieve the objective. This includes a quantitative data analysis with classification using machine learning as the main method, supplemented by qualitative literature research and several qualitative expert interviews.
This approach is suitable as it allows for an in-depth analysis and a comprehensive understanding of various algorithms. The literature review will encompass the current state of research, while the practical comparisons will provide empirical findings. Additionally, expert interviews will offer valuable insights from practitioners, resulting in well-founded and practical recommendations.
## Own Contribution:
My own contribution of this thesis consists of the discussion of the current state of research and practice, the implementation and evaluation of various methods and algorithms for classification, and the implementation and evaluation of expert interviews. After these implementations, I will compare my results with the current state of theory and practice. Additionally, implications for future research are suggested at the end of the thesis, along with the formulation of general solution patterns.
